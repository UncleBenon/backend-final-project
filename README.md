# Backend Final Project

```plaintext
npm install
npx prisma generate
npm run clean-start
```

> ## Issues with boilerplate
>> The boilerplate supplied was outdated, and only works for Node >=18 <19
>>
>> Made the entire project from 0 and imported the Jsons and Postman tests manually.
>>
>> No idea what to do with the amenities.json
>>
>> Opted to go for up-to-date packages (ie; prisma 7, bettersql for prisma)

> ## AI Usage
>
>> Little to no AI use.
>>
>> Only used it to debug some errors prisma was throwing at me and to ask for options. (ie: error on delete, learned about onDelete that way.)
